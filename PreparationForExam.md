## Theory subjects (titles are based on the lecture slides)

**Note**: the subjects below can be adjusted (shortened, grouped differently) at the exam, so don't consider this as an absolute definitive list

### Chapter I. Error Control Coding (cyclic codes)
1. Cyclic codes: definition, generator polynomial, proof of the cyclic property
2. Circuits for multiplication / division of binary polynomials (1 out of 4): schematic, operation, what do they do
3. Systematic cyclic encoder circuit (1-error-correcting): schematic, operation, explain why it outputs the desired codeword
4. Deduce the parity-check matrix H for systematic cyclic codes
5. Systematic cyclic decoder with LFSR (1-error-correcting): schematic, operation, prove why it corrects the erroneous  bit
6. Thresholding cyclic decoder: explanations, schematic, operation

### Chapter II. Random signals
7. Random variables: definition, realization, sample space, discrete/continous, PMF and CDF (discrete), CDF and PDF (continuous), basic properties of PDF/PMF/CDF
8. Random process: definition, discrete/continous-time, realization, distributions of order 1,2,..n,
9. Statistical and temporal averages
10. Stationarity (definition and consequences) and ergodicity
11. Autocorrelation function: definition, Wiener-Khinchin theorem (no proof), properties (with proofs)

### Chapter III. Elements of Signal Detection Theory
12. Model schematic, explanation of blocks, particularization for binary case
13. Minimum risk criterion (for binary case): definition of costs, risk, proof of the decision rule, particular cases (ideal observer, maximum likelihood)

## Exercises
